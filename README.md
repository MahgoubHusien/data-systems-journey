# C++ Infrastructure Learning Journey

Goal:
Become intermediate in C++ for infrastructure and distributed systems,
with strong foundations in memory, concurrency, OS, networking, and design.

Structure:
- loop0-memory: C++ ownership, RAII, lifetime
- loop1-concurrency: threads, synchronization, shutdown
- loop2-os-io: processes, file descriptors, lifecycle
- loop3-networking: TCP services, failure handling
- loop4-distributed: replication, coordination simulations
- ood-drills: object-oriented design interview practice

Rules:
- Every system evolves across loops
- Earlier concepts are reused and stressed
- No toy projects
- Failure logs are mandatory

This repo is the source of truth for code.
